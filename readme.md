Customer Churn Prediction Project Explanation
This is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project that predicts customer churn for telecom companies using advanced data science techniques and interactive visualization.

Project Overview
Business Problem: Customer churn costs companies millions in lost revenue. Identifying at-risk customers early enables proactive retention strategies, significantly improving profitability.

Solution: A complete ML pipeline that analyzes customer data, predicts churn probability, and provides actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard.

Key Business Value
Proactive Customer Retention: Identify high-risk customers before they leave

Revenue Protection: Reduce churn rates by 15-30% through targeted interventions

Resource Optimization: Focus retention efforts on customers most likely to churn

Strategic Insights: Understand key churn drivers to improve business strategy

Technical Architecture
Data Science Workflow
1. Data Collection & Exploration

Uses Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers, 21 features)

Comprehensive EDA revealing 26.5% baseline churn rate

Identifies data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formats)

2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Handles missing values in TotalCharges column

Converts categorical variables to numeric encodings

Standardizes inconsistent entries ("No internet service" → "No")

Implements robust error handling for edge cases

3. Advanced Feature Engineering

Customer Lifecycle Features: Tenure groups, contract risk scores

Financial Features: Customer lifetime value, average monthly spending

Service Usage Features: Service adoption scores, payment method indicators

Interaction Features: Senior citizen family combinations

4. Machine Learning Pipeline
