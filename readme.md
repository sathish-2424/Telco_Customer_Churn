## 🔍 **Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard**

**Predict. Prevent. Profit.**
🚀 *A full-stack machine learning solution for telecom customer retention*

---

### 🧩 **Project Summary**

A high-impact, end-to-end data science project designed to **predict customer churn**, provide **actionable business insights**, and deliver results via an **interactive web dashboard**. Built with scalability and deployment in mind, this project demonstrates both technical mastery and business acumen.

---

### 💼 **Business Problem**

Customer churn costs telecom companies **millions in lost revenue** annually. This project offers a proactive solution to identify at-risk customers **before** they leave.

---

### ✅ **Key Business Outcomes**

* **🔔 Early Detection** of high-risk customers
* **💸 Revenue Retention** with 15–30% churn reduction
* **🎯 Focused Interventions** on critical segments
* **📊 Strategic Insight** into churn-driving behaviors

---

### 🛠️ **Technical Architecture**

#### **🔄 ML Pipeline**

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**

   * 7K+ Telco records
   * Handled missing/inconsistent data
2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Customer lifetime value, risk scores, contract behavior
3. **Modeling**

   * 🎯 XGBoost (best), Logistic Regression, Random Forest
   * **Accuracy**: 84.2%, **AUC-ROC**: 0.85+
4. **Evaluation & Insights**

   * Cross-validation, feature importance, cost-benefit analysis

---

### 🧰 **Tech Stack**

* **Backend:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, joblib
* **Frontend:** Streamlit, Plotly, Responsive UI
* **Deployment Ready:** Real-time API, model versioning, CRM integration

---

### 📊 **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**

#### 1. **Churn Prediction Interface**

* Customer-level risk prediction
* Visual churn risk gauge
* Auto-generated retention recommendations

#### 2. **Analytics Dashboard**

* Real-time KPIs: churn rate, tenure, revenue
* Interactive visualizations for trends and segments

#### 3. **Model Insights**

* Feature importance and SHAP visualizations
* Business-impact-focused reporting

---

### 📌 **Key Insights**

* 🧾 **Month-to-month contracts** → 3x higher churn
* ⏳ **60% churn** happens within first 6 months
* 💳 **Electronic check users** = high-risk segment
* 📦 High charges without service bundling = increased churn

---

### 📈 **Strategic Recommendations**

* Offer **longer-term contracts with benefits**
* Improve **onboarding and early engagement**
* Bundle services for **value perception**
* Promote **automated payment methods**
